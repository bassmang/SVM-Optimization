# SVM-Optimization

This project implements the SVM model using the SMO method and quadratic penalty method. It also uses an RBF kernel and a cubic kernel to investigate the accuracy and runtime with a specified parameter values. The file COMP0120_Project.pdf offers a clear description of the project.
